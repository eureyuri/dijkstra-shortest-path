# dijkstra-shortest-path
Uses Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between two given vertices/places.

## Getting Started
Prepare set of ids and edge weights that describe the individual locations and the distances between each of them respectively. 
<br />
The command line will prompt you to imput these files in .txt format. Refer to test_ids.txt and test_edge_weights.txt for example.
<br />
When you imput these files, it will ouput an answer.txt file where there will be the directions that will lead you from the starting to the ending location. 

## What's Next
Integrate with Google Maps.
